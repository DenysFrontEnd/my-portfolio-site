            The "Bank Project" is a beginner's endeavor focusing on essential
            banking functionalities. It includes robust features such as user
            authentication and the capability to transfer funds between
            accounts. This project aims to simulate a secure banking environment
            where users can authenticate themselves through a login system. Once
            logged in, they can initiate transfers from one account to another
            within the system. While simple in scope, the project underscores
            foundational principles of web development and security practices,
            making it a valuable learning experience for aspiring developers.

            In this project file, I've been learning the fundamentals of GitHub
            posting and programming. It's been an insightful journey exploring
            the mechanics of version control through GitHub, where I've
            practiced committing changes, creating branches, and pushing
            updates. Additionally, I've delved into the basics of programming,
            honing skills in structuring code, understanding variables, and
            implementing simple algorithms. This experience has laid a solid
            foundation for my journey into the world of software development,
            fostering a deeper understanding of how to effectively manage code
            and build functional programs.

            In this project, I've been learning to work with JavaScript,
            exploring its versatility and power in web development. I've focused
            on understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript syntax, manipulating
            the Document Object Model (DOM), and handling events to create
            interactive and dynamic elements on web pages. Through this
            experience, I've gained hands-on practice in writing functions,
            using variables effectively, and integrating JavaScript with HTML
            and CSS. This foundational knowledge in JavaScript has equipped me
            with essential skills to enhance user experience and functionality
            in web applications.
